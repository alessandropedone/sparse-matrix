# Sparse matrix 

Test:
- reader() for matrix market format
- with a given matrix
- time with Chrono.hpp

Parallelization with std algorithms 
(or blas library: ask other teams and check pacs-examples)

Modified compressed techniques (MSR, MSC)
- SquareMatrix: derived from Matrix, it has modified compressed formats too
- Matrix and SquareMatrix has a transpose views 
- SquareMatrix has a diagonal view
  
README.md (need of TBB, we didn't implement COO since COOmap is clearly more efficient)
