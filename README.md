# Sparse matrix 

## Important
Matrix class implementation
- matrix-matrix product: there's an example from which we can tke inspiration (but i think this is already a very good solution)
- views (extra): diagonal and transpose (see modified compressed techniques)

Reader of matrix market format

Test:
- with a given matrix
- time with Chrono.hpp

Parallelization with std algorithms 
(or blas library: ask other teams and check pacs-examples)

## Secondary

Additional aspects
- COO (standard) possible inheritance
- Modified compressed techniques

Final aspects:
- README.md (need of TBB)
