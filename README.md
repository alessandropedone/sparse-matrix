# Sparse matrix 

Test:
- rowmajor + colmajor

Parallelization with std algorithms 

Modified compressed techniques (MSR, MSC)
- SquareMatrix: derived from Matrix, it has modified compressed formats too
- SquareMatrix has a transpose and diagonal view
  
README.md (need of TBB, we didn't implement COO since COOmap is clearly more efficient, explain why parallel implementation of compress is slower)

Extra
-blas library: ask other teams and check pacs-examples
